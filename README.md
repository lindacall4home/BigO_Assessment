# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    The purpose of Big 0 is to understand the relative efficiency of algorithms as the size of the input increases.  With this understanding, we will be equipped to make decisions about the best algorithms to use in different situations.

 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    Relative speed and memory usage.

 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   Binary Search

---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)


    O(log n)

---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    O(1) takes the same amount of time regardless of inputs (a loop from 0 - 10).

    O(n) increases linearly as the size of the input increases (looping over all elements of an array).

    O(log n) increases according to log n as the size of the input increases. (Doing a binary search).  This is faster than O(n) and has a flatter curve.

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    O(n log n) would be something like a merge sort that takes multiple steps to complete. (A merge sort divides unsorted lists into n lists of 1 element each and then repeatedly merges the lists into one another until they are all merged into one list.) O(n log n) is slower than O(log n). O(log n) would be something like a binary search.
